JavaScript & DOM Cheatsheet
A quick reference guide for the functions and methods used in this project.

1. Functions & Logic
Arrow Function: A shorter syntax for writing functions.
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
typeof: Returns the data type of a variable.
typeof "Maha"; // "string"
Strict Equality (===): Compares both value and data type.
5 === "5"; // false
Destructuring Swap: Swapping two variables without a temp variable.
[a, b] = [b, a];
2. DOM (Document Object Model)
getElementById: Selects an HTML element by its ID.
document.getElementById("namebox");
.value: Gets or sets the text inside an input field.
const val = input.value;
3. Strings
Concatenation: Joining strings using +.
let d = "Hello " + name + "!";
Template Literals: Embedding variables inside backticks (`).
let e = Hello ${a}, ${b}!;
toUpperCase / toLowerCase: Changes the casing of a string.
str.toUpperCase();
trim: Removes whitespace from both ends of a string.
str.trim();
split: Breaks a string into an array based on a separator.
fullName.split(" ");
replace: Replaces a specific part of a string with another.
str.replace("old", "new");
4. Arrays
push / pop: Adds/Removes an element at the end.
arr.push("item"); / arr.pop();
unshift / shift: Adds/Removes an element at the beginning.
arr.unshift("item"); / arr.shift();
indexOf: Returns the first index of a value, or -1 if not found.
arr.indexOf("blue");
includes: Returns true/false if an element exists.
arr.includes("yellow");
splice: Changes contents of an array by removing or replacing elements and returns removed elements.
arr.splice(index, count);
forEach: Executes a function for each array element.
arr.forEach(x => console.log(x));
map: Creates a new array by performing a function on every element.
let doubled = arr.map(x => x * 2);
filter: Creates a new array with elements that pass a test.
let nums = arr.filter(x => typeof x === 'number');
5. Math & Numbers
Math.random: Generates a random decimal between 0 and 1.
Math.random();
Math.floor: Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
Math.floor(5.9); // 5
parseInt / parseFloat: Converts a string to an integer or decimal.
parseInt("5"); / parseFloat("0.6");
6. Advanced Array Methods (Reduce)
reduce (Summing): Reduces an array to a single value by adding each element to an accumulator.
const total = prices.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
reduce (Tallying/Counting): Uses an object as an accumulator to count how many times an item appears. const tally = items.reduce((acc, item) => { acc[item] = (acc[item] || 0) + 1; // "If exists, +1. If not, start at 0 and +1" return acc; }, {});
Initial Value: The second argument in reduce (like 0 or {}) defines the starting type of the result.
arr.reduce((acc, curr) => {...}, {}); // Starts with empty object
Use reduce to compare items and keep only the "winner."
const max = [10, 50, 30].reduce((acc, curr) => (curr > acc ? curr : acc), 0);
7. Functional Concepts
Callbacks: Passing a function as an argument to another function.
arr.map(x => x * 2); // The arrow function is the callback
Accumulator (acc): The "running total" or stored result that persists across each loop in a reduce function.
Dynamic Keys: Accessing or creating object properties using square brackets and variables.
obj[variableKey] = value;
8. Logic & Short-circuiting
Logical OR (||) for Defaults: Sets a default value if the first part is undefined or null.
let count = acc[item] || 0; // If item doesn't exist, start at 0
9. Asynchronous JavaScript & Timers
Promises: Objects representing the eventual completion (resolve) or failure (reject) of an asynchronous task.
function getData() {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        setTimeout(() => resolve("Data received"), 2000);
    });
}
.then() / .catch(): Methods used to handle the result or errors of a Promise once it settles. code JavaScript getData() .then(data => console.log(data)) .catch(err => console.error(err)); setTimeout: Executes a function once after a specified delay in milliseconds. setTimeout(() => console.log("Done"), 3000); // Runs after 3s setInterval: Repeatedly executes a function at every fixed time interval. setInterval(() => console.log("Repeating"), 3000); // Runs every 3s

Alternative Methods to Get Full DataWhile .json() is for structured data, you can use these other methods to download the entire response body: .text(): Downloads the whole body and returns it as a plain string. .blob(): Downloads the whole body and returns it as a Blob object, which is useful for images, PDFs, or other binary files. .arrayBuffer(): Downloads the whole body and returns it as a low-level binary buffer. .formData(): Parses the response as form-encoded data.
const response = await fetch('https://example.com/data');
// This line pauses until the ENTIRE body is finished downloading const rawText = await response.text();

console.log("Download complete!", rawText);

JavaScript API Fetching and Promise Chaining
This document provides a concise overview of the concepts and functions used when interacting with public APIs using modern JavaScript.

Core Definitions
API Calling: The process of a client application sending a request to a remote server to retrieve or manipulate data.
Fetch API: A modern, built-in JavaScript interface used to make network requests and handle responses across the web.
Promise Chaining: A technique where multiple .then() methods are linked together to execute asynchronous operations in a specific sequential order.
.json() Method: A function that parses the raw response from a fetch request and converts it into a usable JavaScript object or array.
.filter() Function: An array method that creates a new array containing only the elements that meet a specific logical condition.
.map() Function: An array method used to transform data by creating a new array where every element has been modified by a provided function.
.catch() Block: A method used at the end of a promise chain to handle and manage any errors that occur during the request or processing.
